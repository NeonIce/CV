### About Me

I’m a passionate, creative, and detail-oriented software engineer with over eight years of professional experience building and improving web platforms used by financial professionals and investors. I thrive on solving complex problems, delivering reliable solutions, and crafting intuitive front-end experiences that make technology accessible and engaging.

Having been part of SECCL’s early startup team, I’ve helped shape systems, processes, and products from the ground up. I’m at my best when collaborating with others to turn great ideas into scalable, maintainable, and meaningful technology.
