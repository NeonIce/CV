### About Me

Hi, I'm Michael, a full-stack Software Engineer from the South of England. For the last 8 years I’ve been working at SECCL Technology Ltd, helping the company grow from an early-stage startup into one of the key players in the UK fintech industry. During that time, I’ve contributed across many areas of the business, with a particular focus on the UI and API.

I’m now looking for a new opportunity with a team that cares about clean, well-tested code where I can continue learning, growing, and contributing to products that make a difference and ideally, I’d love to join a company that values thoughtful design, mentoring, and team wellbeing as much as technical skill.

### Professional Experience

**Software Engineer**
*SECCL Technology Ltd – Bath (Remote hybrid)*
*July 2017 – Present*

SECCL is a modern wealth management platform used by firms like Monzo, P1, and Söderberg. I joined during its startup phase and have contributed to the investor and adviser platforms, evolving from a front-end specialist into a full-stack contributor with strong product instincts.

#### Key Contributions

* Helped SECCL scale from a 10-person startup to a company now serving major clients such as Monzo and Söderberg.
* Built and maintained React-based interfaces for investors and advisers, ensuring responsiveness, performance, and accessibility.
* Collaborated cross-functionally with product, design, and backend teams to deliver features that serve both end users and internal stakeholders.
* Led development on several UI modules enabling advisers to manage portfolios, fees, clients, and documentation via the adviser portal.
* Recently contributed to the backend API, implementing new `GET` and `PATCH` endpoints to allow firms to self-serve on branding and legal text updates, reducing customer support overhead.
* Participated in agile ceremonies using Fibonacci-based sprint planning (story points), retros, and reviews within a mature Scrum environment.
* Helped maintain UI consistency through component libraries and design system updates.
* Supported continuous deployment, testing, and QA processes in a fast-paced, regulated industry environment.
* Improved internal efficiency by helping to create a self-service branding tool that reduced the number of branding-related support tickets.
