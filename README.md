### About Me
---
I am a passionate, creative and organised individual looking to forge a career doing what I love: using cool tech to build amazing stuff online. I love a challenge and am always interested in learning new languages and skills and am always looking to expend my knowledge into new areas.

Being naturally creative I like to think outside of the box to improve upon the skills and knowledge I already have and I am always trying to push myself with anything that I do. As such I am able to work well as a part of a team or on my own.
